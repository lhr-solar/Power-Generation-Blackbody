## 0.1.0

Initial version.

## 0.2.0

**Schematic**

- Errata fix for no power connections to Blackbody C.
- Switched to M3 mounting holes.
- Standardized schematic into hierarchical sheets.
- Updated component listings with a focus on JLCPCB assembly and cost reduction.
- Swapped out isolated 12V-9V regulator for nonisolated 12V-5V regulator.

**Layout**

- Major layout changes oriented towards a single sided PCB assembly (as most parts now are assembled by JLCPCB for cheaper).
- Improvement to interface connector placement and user interface (buttons, LEDs).

## 0.3.0rc (proposed)

- Multiplexer to simplify 8 MAX chips to 1 MAX chip and 8 outlets. Consider resistance increase and error.
